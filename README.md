          <h2>about us</h2>
          <p>
            There is an old saying which we live by. <strong>“One man's trash is another man's treasure.”</strong> You
            have probably
            heard it countless times, but you may not have realized the impact that 'unwanted junk' can have on
            the lives of those who need all the help that they can get. At south Bay Junk Services, we realize just
            what an impact old, unwanted items can have. It is for this reason that we work with a handful of
            charities that make use of the items that we have collected, wherever possible. When we cannot
            repurpose items, we do not simply add them to a garbage heap. We strongly believe that we have
            a responsibility to get rid of these items responsibly, which is why, when we cannot give the
            items to those in need, we recycle them.

                Did you know that mattresses, or at least incorrectly disposed of mattresses, are considered harmful
                substances to the
                environment? This means that they cannot simply be dumped - they must be disposed of properly. This is
                not only a waste
                of time for many people but also something that requires a fair amount of research. Avoid the hassle and
                allow us to
                remove and dispose of your bed and mattress responsibly!

                An indisposed hot tub can become a massive concern for your health and
                safety. Not only is it a drowning risk if excess water cannot be removed, but it can
                also become a breeding ground for pests and vermin.
                this is not to mention that a non-working hot tub is more of a hindrance than anything
                else! We carefully disassemble and dispose of hot tubs of all kinds. We do this
                ethically, ensuring that every part is recycled as it should be.

              Here are some general pricing guidelines:
              <br>
            <h5>Volume-Based Pricing</h5>
            Most junk removal companies like Just Junk or 800 got junk charge based on the amount
            of space your items take up in their truck.
            <br>
            Prices typically range from $100 to $600 or
            more, depending on the volume.
            <br>

            - Minimum load: $100 - $150

            - Quarter load: $150 - $250

            - Half load: $250 - $400

            - Full load: $400 - $600+

            <h5>Item-Specific Pricing</h5>
            Some companies offer pricing based on specific items.
            <br>
            For instance:

            - Single item (e.g., mattress, sofa): $50 - $100

            - Appliances (e.g., refrigerator, washer): $75 - $150

            depending on the complexity of the job.

            <h5>Additional Fees</h5>

            There may be extra charges for certain services, such as:

            - Heavy or bulky items

            - Hazardous materials

            - Long carry distances

            <summary>Is there free junk removal?</summary>
            <p>
              In Los Angeles county, there are limited options for free junk removal, but there are some avenues you can
              explore:

            <h5>Curbside Collection</h5>

            The City of London offers curbside collection for certain types of waste, including bulk items, on
            designated collection days. Check the city's waste management schedule and guidelines to see if your
            items qualify.

            <h5>Donation Centers</h5>

            If your items are in good condition, consider donating them to local charities or organizations like
            Goodwill, Habitat for Humanity ReStore, or Salvation Army. These organizations often offer free pickup
            for large donations.

            <h5>Online Marketplaces</h5>

            Platforms like Kijiji, Facebook Marketplace, and Freecycle allow you to list items for free. Someone in
            the community may be willing to pick up your unwanted items at no cost.

            <h5>Recycling Programs</h5>

            Some materials, such as electronics, can be recycled for free through specific programs. Check with
            local electronics retailers or recycling centers for free e-waste disposal options.

            <h5>Community Cleanup Events</h5>

            Occasionally, local community groups or the city may organize cleanup events where volunteers help
            remove unwanted items from homes and properties. Keep an eye on community bulletin boards and local news
            for announcements.

            For larger or more specific junk removal needs, you might need to consider paid services or inquire
            about any available assistance programs in the area.
