          <h2>about us</h2>
          <p>
            There is an old saying which we live by. <strong>“One man's trash is another man's treasure.”</strong> You
            have probably heard it countless times, but you may not have realized the impact that 'unwanted junk' can have on
            the lives of those who need all the help that they can get. <br>
            <br>
            At south Bay Junk Services, we realize just what an impact old, unwanted items can have. It is for this reason that 
            we work with a handful of charities that make use of the items that we have collected, wherever possible. <br>
            <br>
            When we cannot repurpose items, we do not simply add them to a garbage heap. We strongly believe that we have
            a responsibility to get rid of these items responsibly, which is why, when we cannot give the items to those in need, 
            we recycle them.

                                Did you know that mattresses, or at least incorrectly disposed of mattresses, are considered 
                                harmful substances to the environment? This means that they cannot simply be dumped - they must 
                                be disposed of properly. <br>
                                <br>
                                This is not only a waste of time for many people but also something that requires a fair amount 
                                of research. Avoid the hassle and allow us to remove and dispose of your bed and mattress 
                                responsibly!

                              <br>
                              Much of the organic material that you are left with can be composted, though there will certainly 
                              be items that you will need to have removed. We offer comprehensive yard waste removal so that your 
                              next landscaping project gets done with no issues!

                              There are some items that our clientele are keen to get rid of, but the sheer size, shape, and or

                              Old pool tables, appliances, and above-ground pools are examples of items that can be near

                              An indisposed hot tub can become a massive concern for your health and safety. Not only is it a 
                              drowning risk if excess water cannot be removed, but it can also become a breeding ground for 
                              pests and vermin. <br> 
                              This is not to mention that a non-working hot tub is more of a hindrance than anything else! 
                              We carefully disassemble and dispose of hot tubs of all kinds. We do this ethically, ensuring that 
                              every part is recycled as it should be.

              decades of clutter that she had inside her home. I knew I couldn't get through
              everything myself, so I hired Los Angeles Junk Removal to assist. They were
              incredibly professional, helpful, and hardworking. If you need help

              who delivered the new chairs didn't help us move the old ones out. We called
              Los Angeles Junk Removal and they helped us get the chairs out of the house and

            <summary>How Much Does Junk Removal Cost?</summary>
            <p>The cost of junk removal in Los Angeles county may vary depending on several factors,
              including the volume and type of junk, the time required for removal, and any
              additional services needed.
              <br>
              Here are some general pricing guidelines:
              </p>
            <h5>Volume-Based Pricing</h5>
            <p>
            Most junk removal companies like Just Junk or 800 got junk charge based on the amount
            of space your items take up in their truck.
            <br>
            Prices typically range from $100 to $1000 plus..???
            more, depending on the volume.
            <br>
            For example:

            - Minimum load: $150 - $200

            - Quarter load: $200 - $350

            - Half load: $400 - $600

            - Full load: $800 - $1200+
            </p>
            <h5>Item-Specific Pricing</h5>
            <p>
            Some companies offer pricing based on specific items.
            <br>
            For instance:

            - Single item (e.g., mattress, sofa): $100 - $150

            - Appliances (e.g., refrigerator, washer): $75 - $150

            - Electronics (e.g., TVs, computers): $50 - $100
            </p>
            <h5>Hourly Rates</h5>
            <p>
            In some cases, companies might charge an hourly rate, typically ranging from $50 to $100 per hour,
            depending on the complexity of the job.
            </p>
            <h5>Additional Fees</h5>
            <p>
            There may be extra charges for certain services, such as:

            - Heavy or bulky items

            - Hazardous materials

            - Long carry distances

            - Multiple trips
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Is there free junk removal?</summary>
            <p>
              In Los Angeles county, there are limited options for free junk removal, but there are some avenues you can
              explore:
            </p>
            <h5>Curbside Collection</h5>
            <p>
            The City of Los Angeles offers curbside collection for certain types of waste, including bulk items, on
            designated collection days. Check the city's waste management schedule and guidelines to see if your
            items qualify.
            </p>
            <h5>Donation Centers</h5>
            <p>
            If your items are in good condition, consider donating them to local charities or organizations like
            Goodwill, Habitat for Humanity ReStore, or Salvation Army. These organizations often offer free pickup
            for large donations.
            </p>
            <h5>Online Marketplaces</h5>
            <p>
            Platforms like Craiglist, Facebook Marketplace, and Freecycle allow you to list items for free. Someone in
            the community may be willing to pick up your unwanted items at no cost.
            </p>
            <h5>Recycling Programs</h5>
            <p>
            Some materials, such as electronics, can be recycled for free through specific programs. Check with
            local electronics retailers or recycling centers for free e-waste disposal options.
            </p>
            <h5>Community Cleanup Events</h5>
            <p>
            Occasionally, local community groups or the city may organize cleanup events where volunteers help
            remove unwanted items from homes and properties. Keep an eye on community bulletin boards and local news
            for announcements.

            For larger or more specific junk removal needs, you might need to consider paid services or inquire
            about any available assistance programs in the area.
